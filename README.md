As an avid Kendrick Lamar fan, this was a fun project to create that monitored the changes to Lamar's cryptic website oklama.com ahead of his latest
album release "Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers". This project fetches some development files from that website and displays all of the active pages
to his web app. Pretty simple, but it displayed the data in a much more digestable way. (PS: The album finally dropped and it is fantastic!)
